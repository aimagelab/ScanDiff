### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management with Hydra
This project uses [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) to manage configurations in a flexible and composable way.
All experiment settings (e.g., data, model, diffusion parameters) are defined in YAML files inside the ```configs/``` directory.

Hydra allows to easily override or combine configuration options directly from the command line without modifying the source files.

For more details, visit the [Hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/)!

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download Checkpoints
Download freeviewing and visual search [checkpoints](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/ScanDiff_ICCV2025/checkpoints.zip) with the following command:
```bash
wget -O checkpoints.zip https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/ScanDiff_ICCV2025/checkpoints.zip && unzip checkpoints.zip -d checkpoints && rm checkpoints.zip
```


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Start!
We provide a simple ```demo.py``` script to generate scanpaths for a certain image

1. Generate scanpaths in the freeviewing setting:
```bash
python demo.py image_path=<image_path> viewing_task="" checkpoint_path=<freeviewing_ckpt_path> num_output_scanpaths=10
```

2. Generate scanpaths in the visual search setting:
```bash
python demo.py image_path=<image_path> viewing_task="bottle" checkpoint_path=<freeviewing_ckpt_path> num_output_scanpaths=10
```

### üìù TODO

- [ ] Release data and train-val-test splits.
- [ ] Release **training code** for ScanDiff.
- [ ] Release **evaluation scripts** for benchmark comparisons.
